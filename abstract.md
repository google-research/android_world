Emerging computer control agents, which execute human tasks by controlling
computer interfaces with minimal human supervision, can enhance human productivity
and application accessibility. Yet, progress in this field will be driven by realistic 
and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully-functioning Android environment 
that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic task workflows across 20 real-world 
Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld 
supports task workflows that can be parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited 
ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and realistic suite of tasks. Reward signals are 
derived from the computer's system state, making them durable across task variations and also 
extensible across different applications.
